I am strong advocate for code quality and best practices. By that I mean
- writing tests that **make sense** (for frontend - using `Jest` and `React Testing Library`). I'm a big fan of business-oriented integration testing where you mock the API and test the whole feature from the user perspective. For that I was applying `Page Object` pattern to make testing scenario understandable for non-technical people.
- using linters
- following code style guides
- writing meaningful (and maintainable) documentation
- last but not least - take care of **accessibility**

Apart from that:
- I have experience in working with `Micro Frontends` architecture (`single-spa` framework). 
- I was involved for creating an intra-company shared library of components and hooks that were used across multiple applications. 
- I was also involved in setting up the CI/CD pipeline for the project.

An interesting approach that I used in a couple of projects is `Atomic Design` methodology. The idea is relatively simple - treat components as `atoms`, `molecues`, `organisms` and combine them in `templates` and `pages`.
It has it's pros and cons, but I found it very useful in terms of code organization and reusability.
