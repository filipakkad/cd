I’m a strong advocate for code quality and best practices. For me, this includes:

- **Writing tests that make sense:** I regularly use `Jest` and `React Testing Library` for frontend testing. I'm a big proponent of business-oriented integration testing, where the API is mocked and the entire feature is tested from the user’s perspective. To make this process more understandable for non-technical stakeholders, I apply the Page Object pattern to simplify and clarify test scenarios.
- **Linting and code style:** Using linters and following code style guides is essential for keeping code consistent and maintainable across the team.
- **Meaningful documentation:** I believe in writing clear, maintainable documentation that supports both current and future developers.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring our apps are accessible is always a priority. It's not just a box to check—it's about making sure the product is usable for everyone.

Regarding **TypeScript**, I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into mastering the language, including attending trainings and workshops, to fully leverage its capabilities. I use advanced features like **generic types** effectively, ensuring flexibility and type safety across projects. I’m also a firm believer in not using `any`—I actively block its usage at the start of a project by configuring the linter accordingly. TypeScript is not just a tool for me; it’s a way to write maintainable, scalable, and safe code, which significantly reduces the chance of runtime errors.

In terms of frontend architecture, I have experience working with **Micro Frontends** (using the `single-spa` framework), which allows for modular, scalable development across different teams and applications. Additionally, I was involved in building an **intra-company shared library of components and hooks**, which were used across multiple applications. I created these components from scratch, ensuring they were reusable and maintainable. Alongside that, I built stories in `Storybook`, which provided an interactive environment for both developers and stakeholders to review and interact with the components in isolation.

I’ve also helped set up the **CI/CD pipeline** for frontend projects to streamline the development and release process, improving both efficiency and reliability.

One methodology I’ve found particularly interesting is **Atomic Design**. By breaking down components into `atoms`, `molecules`, and `organisms`, and combining them into templates and pages, we can improve code organization and reusability. It has its pros and cons, but overall, I’ve found it to be very helpful in managing large-scale projects.

In short, I bring both hands-on technical skills and a deep understanding of how to build scalable, performant, and maintainable frontend architectures that prioritize quality and user experience.
