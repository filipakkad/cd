I'm an active participant of our internal meetings.
Whenever I see potential risks, or challenges I'm not afraid to speak up and share my concerns or propose solutions & improvements.

I'm also a big fan of measuring adoption of the solutions we deliver. I believe that the best way to improve is to learn from the feedback we get from the users.
