Although my current focus is on frontend development, I consider myself as a full stack passionate. I have worked on projects that required integrating with RESTful APIs with `Node.js` (NestJS) or `Python` (`Django` & `FastAPI`).
Including making changes in the database (either SQL or NoSQL) and setting up the CI/CD pipeline.

Often I need to make changes in the backend code to support the frontend requirements. I am familiar with the concepts of RESTful APIs (and widely understood web development) and I'm always open to jumping outside my primary area of expertise to learn new things.
