Although my specialization is in frontend development, I come from a full-stack background. To provide some context, I
started with programming in `R`â€”primarily for analytics but also for creating web applications using Shiny. I then
transitioned to `Node.js`, where I particularly enjoy working with the `NestJS` framework. In my current role, I
frequently work with Python, including `Django` and `FastAPI`. I have experience with both SQL databases (
e.g., `TypeORM`) and NoSQL databases (e.g., `MongoDB`).

Practically speaking, I have integrated various systems, such as connecting AWS Bedrock to our application for
integrating LLMs, and linking queues in microservices (based on `NestJS`) with frontend applications built
using `Remix`. Recently, I completed a PoC for an application that visualizes large datasets on a map using [`H3` indexes](https://h3geo.org/) (created by Uber).

I aim to approach software development holistically, enabling me to make changes independently or collaborate
effectively with backend developers. I look forward to discussing this in more detail during our conversation, but I
wanted to highlight my experience and commitment to comprehensive software solutions.
