I am familiar with all of the technologies mentioned. I have worked extensively with `TanStack` family of tools, including `React` and `TypeScript`. 
I have also used `TanStack Query` in a few projects (combined with `CQRS` pattern)
I am confident that I can leverage my experience to contribute to the team and the product. 

`TypeScript` is my way to go when it comes to writing maintainable and scalable code - I have been using it for a few years now (like for real - no `any` types in my code 💻)
