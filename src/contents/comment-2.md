I am familiar with all of the technologies mentioned. I have worked extensively with `TanStack` family of tools, including `React` and `TypeScript`. 
I have also used `TanStack Query` in a few projects (combined with `CQRS` pattern)
I am confident that I can leverage my experience to contribute to the team and the product. 

`TypeScript` is my way to go when it comes to writing maintainable and scalable code - I have been using it for a few years now (like for real - no `any` types in my code)

Other technologies I've worked with:
- [`Astro`](https://astro.build/)
- [`Gatsby`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [`Styled Components`](https://styled-components.com/)
- [`React Hook Form`](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [`Formik`](https://formik.org/)
