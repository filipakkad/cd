Iâ€™m very familiar with all the technologies mentioned. I've worked extensively with the `TanStack` family of tools, including `React` and `TypeScript`, and Iâ€™ve used `TanStack Query` in multiple projects, often combining it with the `CQRS` pattern to handle complex data flows seamlessly.

`TypeScript` has been my go-to for building maintainable and scalable applications for years now. And yesâ€”I'm serious about it: no `any` types sneaking into my code! ðŸ’» Iâ€™m confident that my experience will allow me to contribute meaningfully to both the team and the product, helping push the boundaries of what's possible.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the other technologies I've worked with:
