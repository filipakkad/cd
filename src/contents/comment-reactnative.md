While my commercial projects to date haven’t required me to use `React Native`, I have explored it through personal side projects. Additionally, I have experience with `Flutter` and `Dart`, which has given me a solid understanding of cross-platform mobile development.

I am confident in my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies. My enthusiasm for diving into `React Native` and applying it in a commercial setting is high. I’m excited about the opportunity to leverage my existing knowledge and skills to contribute to your mobile apps and in-person donation terminals.
