So far my commercial projects didn't require applying any `React Native` knowledge, but I used to play with it as part of my side projects.
Besides, I used to play with `Flutter` and `Dart` - so I am familiar with the concept of cross-platform mobile development.

However, I am confident that I can quickly learn and adapt to the new environment.
