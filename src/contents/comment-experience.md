I started programming in 2014 while pursuing my studies in Quantitative Finance. During my time working as an analyst at
ING Bank and REINO Partners, I developed various tools and solutions to enhance the quality of my analyses, including
cash flow models. My efforts were recognized with an award from ING for the implementation of one of these models (written in VBA ðŸ˜€). My
passion for programming originated from business needs, which served as a powerful motivator. To this day, business
value remains a key driver for creating new solutions.

In 2019, I transitioned fully into programming and joined `BEC`, a ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° company providing software solutions for
Scandinavian banking. This role allowed me to experience the exceptional Scandinavian work culture for the first time,
which I found to be remarkable!

Over the years, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience and successfully delivered numerous end-to-end implementations,
demonstrating my ability to drive projects from inception to completion.
