I must admit that I feel a deep connection to this goal - which doesn't happen often when looking for job as a developer. Although the Catholic Church in Poland is already undergoing digital transformation, I still see many gaps and areas where technological support could be improved. 

I'm highly involved in a mission of digitization and supporting the Church in any IT challenges they might face. I believe (and hope) that my experience and knowledge could be a great asset in this area.

As an example - I've delivered (and maintained) a voluntary project together with my fellow developer    - a custom application for one of the largest Catholic foundations in Poland, the `Fundacja Dzie≈Ço Nowego TysiƒÖclecia`. Our goal was to enhance the efficiency of church institutions, so they could focus more on their mission. The app is actually being used + we received a very positive feedback üòäÔ∏è.
