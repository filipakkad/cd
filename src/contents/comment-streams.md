At `Appsilon`, I managed a team of developers (and took on a product owner role as well) for an external client in the pharmaceutical industry—a highly complex domain.

During my time there, the team grew from 2 to 7 members, and we were tasked with developing multiple applications simultaneously, each with unique challenges and requirements from various stakeholders. As a team leader, I wasn’t just responsible for ensuring the quality of the applications, but also for organizing and streamlining workflows across different work streams to secure timely releases.

I’m really curious to learn more about the nature of the projects you’re working on! What are the key challenges you're facing? Is it more of a multi-tenant application setup, or are you managing several separate applications?
