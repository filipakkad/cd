                        <strong>Why did I apply?</strong>
                        <p>I send applications only to carefully selected offers, and this one aligns closely with what
                            Iâ€™m looking for. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the mission of providing IT solutions for
                            parishesâ€”something Iâ€™ve thought about before. Itâ€™s a business domain (I think) I understand and
                            identify with. </p>  <p>
                        Additionally, the opportunity for greater responsibility, both for the team
                        and the product, is a natural and necessary direction for my development. The offer's
                        conditions (including the Scandinavian work culture) are additional factors that appeal to
                        me. At this stage in my career, Iâ€™m focusing on long-term relationships.
                    </p>

                            Check out my comments to each section of the offer - I hope they will help you get to know me better!
