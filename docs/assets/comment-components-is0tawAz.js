const e="I am strong advocate for code quality and best practices. By that I mean\n- writing tests that **make sense** (for frontend - using `Jest` and `React Testing Library`). I'm a big fan of business-oriented integration testing where you mock the API and test the whole feature from the user perspective. For that I was applying `Page Object` pattern to make testing scenario understandable for non-technical people.\n- using linters\n- following code style guides\n- writing meaningful (and maintainable) documentation\n- last but not least - take care of **accessibility**\n\nApart from that:\n- I have experience in working with `Micro Frontends` architecture (`single-spa` framework). \n- I was involved for creating an intra-company shared library of components and hooks that were used across multiple applications. \n- I was also involved in setting up the CI/CD pipeline for the project.\n\nAn interesting approach that I used in a couple of projects is `Atomic Design` methodology. The idea is relatively simple - treat components as `atoms`, `molecues`, `organisms` and combine them in `templates` and `pages`.\nIt has it's pros and cons, but I found it very useful in terms of code organization and reusability.";export{e as default};
