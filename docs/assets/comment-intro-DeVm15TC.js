const e=`**Hi ChurchDesk team!**

Thanks for checking out this page. I put it together while prepping for my interview and thought itâ€™d be a fun way to share my thoughts with you.

Iâ€™ve gone through each point and highlighted the key aspects from the job description. Hopefully, this gives you a clearer picture of who I am and sparks some interesting conversation.

I whipped this up quickly in my spare time, so please excuse the rough edges. ðŸ˜„

Thanks again for your time, and I look forward to talking with you!
