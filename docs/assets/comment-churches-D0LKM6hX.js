const e=`I must admit that I feel a deep connection to this goal. Although the Catholic Church in Poland is already undergoing digital transformation, I still see many gaps and areas where technological support could be improved. I confess that before I learned about ChurchDesk, I had a similar idea (i.e., creating a framework for parishes), but personal circumstances led me to suspend that idea. 

To further demonstrate my interest, I've delivered another voluntary project with a friend—a custom application for one of the largest Catholic foundations in Poland, the Fundacja Dzieło Nowego Tysiąclecia. Our goal was to enhance the efficiency of church institutions so they could focus more on their mission. We helped streamline the foundation's operations, allowing it to concentrate on its core mission.`;export{e as default};
