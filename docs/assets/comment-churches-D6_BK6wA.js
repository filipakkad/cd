const e=`I must admit that I feel a deep connection to this goal - which doesn't happen often when looking for job as a developer. Although the Catholic Church in Poland is already undergoing digital transformation, I still see many gaps and areas where technological support could be improved. 
I confess that before I learned about \`ChurchDesk\`, I had a similar idea (i.e., creating a framework for parishes administration), but personal circumstances led me to suspend that idea. 

And now I've found you and your product! Being able to learn from your experience and contribute to the development of such a product would be an ideal fit for me.

One more note on my experience and background - I've delivered (and maintained) a voluntary project together with my friend - a custom application for one of the largest Catholic foundations in Poland, the \`Fundacja Dzie≈Ço Nowego TysiƒÖclecia\`. Our goal was to enhance the efficiency of church institutions, so they could focus more on their mission. The app is actually being used + we received a very positive feedback üòäÔ∏è.
