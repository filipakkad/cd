const e=`I am curious how different are these projects? What are the challenges you are facing? Is more of a multi-tenant application or several separate applications? 

As for my experience - at \`Appsilon\` I was managing a team of developers (acting as product owner too) - our team grew from 2 to 7 members. We were developing concurrently multiple applications and facing different challenges and requirements for multiple stakeholders.
Therefore, as a team leader I was not only responsible for quality of the code but also for organizing workflow across different streams. `;export{e as default};
