const e=`My coding adventure started in 2014. Initially I was working as an analyst at \`ING Bank\` for commercial real estate investments.
I started solving business problems with the code and later on in 2019 I decided to switch to a full-time developer role. 

Having a background in finance and business has been a great asset in my career. I can easily understand the business requirements and translate them into technical solutions.`;export{e as default};
