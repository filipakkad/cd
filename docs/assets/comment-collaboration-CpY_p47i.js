const e=`In my role, I am an active participant in discussions with product managers and stakeholders. I’m not afraid to voice
concerns or offer advice on areas where I see potential improvements. I believe that ensuring the quality of the product
goes beyond simply handling technical tasks—it's about critically assessing the feasibility of proposed solutions and
determining the necessary trade-offs to deliver on time while managing technical debt.

Effective collaboration with product managers is key to this process. I engage in meaningful conversations with them,
users, designers, and other stakeholders to refine product features and ensure that the end result aligns with both user needs and
business objectives. This approach helps in making informed decisions and maintaining a high standard of product quality
throughout the development cycle.
