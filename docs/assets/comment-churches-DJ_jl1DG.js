const e=`I have to admit, I strongly identify with this mission. Being closely connected to the Roman Catholic Church in Poland,
I’ve noticed that despite ongoing digital transformation, there’s still a gap in effectively utilizing
technology—especially to help focus on the Church’s core mission.

I’ve taken action. Together with a fellow developer friend, we voluntarily built an application for one of the largest
Catholic foundations in Poland, \`Fundacja Dzieło Nowego Tysiąclecia\`. Our app streamlined the registration process for
fundraising teams during the annual Papal Day, as well as the logistics of distributing materials and handling financial
reporting. The app has been successfully deployed and is currently in use—something I’m really proud of. I also
regularly assist priests in adopting and understanding new technologies (as well as educating them on potential risks),
so they can spend more time on their mission and less time battling with tech!

In short, working on a project like ChurchDesk is incredibly appealing to me. It’s important that the projects I
contribute to have real meaning and impact, and this one definitely does.
