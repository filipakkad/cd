const e=`At \`Appsilon\` I was managing a team of developers (acting as product owner too) to our external client from pharmaceutical industry (complicated domain). 

During my shift our team grew from 2 to 7 members. We were developing concurrently multiple applications and facing different challenges and requirements from multiple stakeholders.
Therefore, as a team leader I was not only responsible for quality of our applications but also for organizing workflow across different streams.

I am curious how different are these projects? What are the challenges you are facing? Is more of a multi-tenant application or several separate applications?
